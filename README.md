# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).

## Algorithm:
1.Identify user pain points. Write 1–2 clear UX problem statements using a defined template: "[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

2.Identifying Appropriate Research Methods Identify the most suitable research methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing, diary studies). Justify your method choice.

3.Creating Personas Based on previous user data or a given user scenario.

4.Create at least two user personas with: Demographics Goals Behaviors Pain points Motivation Submission:

5.Mention the GitHub Repo URL in the submission text and attach the lab report pdf.
## Output:
Problem Statement 1:
"Beginner fitness users need a way to track their daily workouts and progress because they often feel confused or unmotivated when they don’t see improvement, which results in inconsistent exercise habits."

Problem Statement 2:
"Busy working professionals need a way to access simple workout plans based on their schedule because they cannot commit to long or complex routines, which results in skipping workouts and poor fitness outcomes."

Research Methods
Surveys – To collect general information about user fitness goals, preferred workout styles, time availability, and current challenges.
User Interviews – To understand emotional barriers, motivations, and day-to-day workout struggles.
Usability Testing (on low-fidelity prototype) – To check whether users can easily navigate workout plans, progress trackers, and goal-setting tools.

Justification:
Fitness behavior varies greatly between individuals. Surveys help gather broad user trends, while interviews uncover personal motivations and frustrations. Usability testing ensures that the workout-tracking interface is simple enough for beginners and efficient enough for busy users. This combination provides both quantitative and qualitative insights needed for designing an effective fitness website.
